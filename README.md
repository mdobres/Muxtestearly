# Muxtestearly
Early release of Mux Test files for MCP and LED controller
two test programs. Both use the Mux. One tests the 4 MCPS by  printing to the monitor the state of a chess board switches  eg A1 Open or E4 Close. The other does the same thing, but also turns on and off the corresponding LED using  the HT16K33
